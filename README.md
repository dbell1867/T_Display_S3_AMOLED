# Lilygo T-Display S3 AMOLED Practice Projects

These experiments are largely influenced / inspired by the work done by [VolosR](https://github.com/VolosR).  The original desire was to use CircuitPython to explore this board that has a beautiful AMOLED screen.    Python and CircuitPython being the languages with which I have the most experience.  Since this board is not yet supported on CircuitPython, and I do not have the skill to add the support for this board, I have chosen to play with Arduino.  The projects by VolosR, using Arduino and the [Lilygo T-Display S3 AMOLED](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Display-S3-AMOLED), have been very helpful to get me started on my journey.


## Projects
1.  min_req:  The absolute minimum required code to make something appear on the screen. 

2.  circular_sprite_logic:  Playing with the circular dial code of VolosR to understand more complex sprite projects.  

3.  sprite_rotation:  Learning about rotating sprites and text position.

4.  button_test:  Learning to use buttons to control events.  Extension to the sprite_rotation example.

5.  Text experimentation.  Understand built in fonts and custom fonts

6.  Multiple pivot points for sprites with complex interactions.  [VolosR](https://github.com/VolosR) [OverEngineered Blink](https://github.com/VolosR/OEBlink) sketch is the inspiration for this experiment.
