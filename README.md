# Lilygo T-Display S3 AMOLED Projects

These experiments are largely influenced / inspired by the work done by VolosR.  The original desire was to explore using this board, with a beautiful AMOLED screen, using CircuitPython.  Python and CircuitPython being the languages with which I have the most experience.  Since this board is not yet supported on CIrcuitPython, and I do not have the skill to add the support for this board, I have chosen to play with Arduino.  The project by VolosR, using Arduino, have been very helpful to get started.


## Projects
min_req:  The absolute minimum required code to make something appear on the screen. 

circular_sprite_logic:  Playing with the circular dial code of VolosR to understand more complex sprite projects.
